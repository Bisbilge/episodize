1
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,548
Before time began, there was the Cube.

2
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,217
We know not where it comes from,

3
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:06,568
only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.

4
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:10,171
That is how our race was born.

5
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,751
For a time, we lived in harmony,

6
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:19,423
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.

7
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:22,668
And so began the war,

8
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:27,807
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,

9
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:33,055
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.

10
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:39,470
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

11
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:44,075
searching every star, every world.

12
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:50,565
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us

13
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:55,107
to an unknown planet called Earth.

14
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,392
But we were already too late.

15
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,949
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,554
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,693
A plate of mama's alligators ¨¦touff¨¦e.

18
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:26,967
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,241
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,651
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:34,815
I understand.

22
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,698
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:44,504
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,809
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:50,851
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:55,992
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:58,768
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:02,839
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,985
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,582
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:08,662
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,606
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,603
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,806
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,118
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:41,391
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,396
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:46,771
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,473
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,150
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,638
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,883
Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.

43
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,797
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,740
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,683
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,338
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,572
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,885
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,550
Tail 4500 X-ray.

50
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,130
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,064
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,231
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

53
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,311
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:55,917
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

55
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:01,359
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,603
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,610
- My ladies!
- Look.

58
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,717
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:15,954
Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.

60
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,789
Baby, we made a good-looking kid.

61
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,030
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,507
but, wow, we made
one good-Iooking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,375
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,077
- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:30,125
You sure she didn't just fart?

66
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,025
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,624
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:39,043
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,786
Bogie's on the deck.

70
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,026
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,402
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,073
- Will?
- Sarah?

73
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:58,586
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:05:58,586 --> 00:05:59,018
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,724
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

76
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:11,808
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

77
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:18,182
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

78
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:30,049
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

79
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,294
My God.

80
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:58,604
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

81
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:28,838
Go! Move! Move!

82
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,487
It's going after the files!

83
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:38,960
Cut the hard lines!

84
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:41,000
I need a key! It's locked!

85
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,534
Move! Move!

86
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,255
Here, come here! Come here!

87
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,320
Here, hide in here!

88
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,527
Oh, my God. Okay.

89
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,191
No!

90
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:16,975
Oh!

91
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,796
What the...

92
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,519
Epps, let's go!

93
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

94
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,740
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

95
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,038
Watch.

96
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,148
Okay.

97
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,848
For my family...

98
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:14,396
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

99
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:18,671
Okay.

100
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:21,802
So, for my family genealogy report,

101
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:25,044
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

102
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,392
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

103
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:29,886
Very famous explorer.

104
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:36,431
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

105
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,747
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

106
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:48,863
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

107
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:54,378
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

108
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:59,316
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

109
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,827
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

110
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:05,030
So that's the story, right?

111
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,334
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

112
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,274
used by 19th-century seamen.

113
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,585
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

114
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:13,984
It's all for sale, by the way.

115
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:18,793
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

116
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:21,367
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

117
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:24,204
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

118
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,543
Are you going to sell me his liver?

119
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:29,245
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

120
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:30,447
I don't think your grandfather would be

121
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:31,786
particularly proud of what you're doing.

122
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:35,128
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

123
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,294
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

124
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,737
Cold hard cash works, too.

125
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:41,141
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

126
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,578
- Sam!
- Sorry.

127
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,513
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

128
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:49,459
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

129
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:50,725
drawing these strange symbols

130
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,304
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

131
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,068
that he thought he'd discovered.

132
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:59,013
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

133
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,418
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

134
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:03,856
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

135
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,523
Okay. Pretty good, right?

136
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,873
I'd say a solid B-.

137
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:13,568
A B-?

138
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,707
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

139
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:16,980
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

140
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:18,317
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

141
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,759
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

142
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,422
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,164
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

144
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,037
And a man's promise to that boy.

145
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,978
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

146
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,348
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

147
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,583
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

148
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,757
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

149
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:43,666
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

150
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,411
Yes! Yes, yes.

151
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:48,921
So?

152
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:50,223
A-. It's an A, though.

153
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:52,089
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

154
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,891
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

155
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,901
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

156
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,234
Yeah, a little surprise.

157
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,879
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

158
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,348
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

159
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,399
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

160
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:15,769
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

161
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,346
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

162
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:20,112
a Porsche for your first car?

163
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,418
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

164
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:26,021
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

165
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,642
- Manny!
- What?

166
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,207
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

167
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,408
He's having a heat stroke again.

168
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:35,576
Scaring white folks.

169
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,588
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

170
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,022
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

171
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,690
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

172
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,169
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

173
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:46,742
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

174
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,175
- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.

175
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,377
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

176
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,251
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

177
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,554
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

178
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:56,925
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

179
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:58,090
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:02,972
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

181
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,170
How can I help you?

182
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,046
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

183
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,049
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

184
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:14,532
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

185
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:17,003
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

186
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,973
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

187
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:26,088
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

188
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,122
The car'll pick the driver.

189
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:31,030
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

190
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:34,040
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

191
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:38,675
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

192
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,451
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

193
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:45,623
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

194
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:53,271
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

195
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:54,817
This ain't bad.

196
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:58,149
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,592
It got racing...

198
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,098
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

199
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,966
I don't know nothing about this car.

200
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:05,301
- Manny!
- What?

201
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:08,004
What is this? This car! Check it out!

202
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,607
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!

203
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,213
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

204
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:14,850
Feels good.

205
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,430
- How much?
- Well,

206
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:24,405
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

207
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:26,313
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

208
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:30,484
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

209
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:31,619
It's custom faded?

210
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,496
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

211
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:37,403
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

212
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,403
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

213
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,072
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

214
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:44,383
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

215
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:47,656
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

216
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,892
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

217
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,598
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

218
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,735
This is a classic engine right here.

219
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,179
I sold a car the other day...

220
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,655
Gee. Holy cow.

221
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,192
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

222
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:06,064
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

223
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:07,831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

224
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,068
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

225
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:12,114
...greater than man...

226
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:15,312
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

227
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,558
$4,000.

228
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:47,380
Steve.

229
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,391
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

230
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:52,991
They're so young.

231
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,230
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

232
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,605
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

233
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,081
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

234
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,185
I am so underdressed.

235
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,285
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

236
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,830
Please be seated.

237
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:13,871
I'm John Keller.

238
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:17,246
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

239
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,523
At 1900 local time yesterday,

240
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,826
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.

241
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:27,301
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

242
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:31,010
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

243
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,243
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

244
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:36,791
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

245
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:40,764
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

246
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:44,174
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

247
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:48,272
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

248
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,561
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

249
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:02,136
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

250
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,715
and intercept further communications,

251
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:06,617
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

252
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:10,925
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

253
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,631
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

254
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,334
The President has dispatched
battle groups

255
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:20,610
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

256
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:22,346
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

257
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:25,358
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

258
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,986
Good luck to us all.

259
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:39,890
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

260
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,596
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

261
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,829
Zero bids.

262
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,609
Great. Broke.

263
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:53,083
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

264
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,389
No. Premature.

265
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,825
Good. What's up?

266
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,765
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

267
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:04,268
It's like clockwork.

268
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,970
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

269
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,143
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

270
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,553
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

271
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:15,759
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

272
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:17,062
This one is wobbly.

273
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,270
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

274
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:22,505
- Sam...
- What?

275
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,177
I do not like footprints on my grass.

276
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,484
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

277
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,288
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

278
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,524
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

279
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,729
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

280
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,933
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

281
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,206
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

282
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:39,874
That's his bling.

283
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,187
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,156
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

285
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,389
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

286
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:47,727
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:57,711
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:01,827
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:12,242
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

290
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:13,755
Oh, my God.

291
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,688
Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,

292
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,922
our highest readiness level.

293
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,964
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,439
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,581
But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...

296
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:28,513
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:32,350
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,327
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:38,531
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,940
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,209
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,616
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

303
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,881
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:49,964
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:54,032
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,640
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,339
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:02,821
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:06,793
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,803
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,341
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,775
My radio's fried.

313
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,877
- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.

314
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,958
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,584
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:22,358
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:28,141
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:32,117
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:35,050
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,693
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

321
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,360
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

322
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,438
Okay.

323
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:48,115
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,589
Oh, hi.

325
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,790
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:01,004
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,617
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:06,221
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,793
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

330
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:10,867
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

331
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,736
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,746
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,548
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,953
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:24,427
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:29,565
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

337
00:21:29,674 --> 00:21:31,906
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:35,179
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

339
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:37,849
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:39,654
That's funny.

341
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,459
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,539
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

343
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,706
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:52,413
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

345
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:54,552
What are you doing?

346
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,720
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,267
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:02,638
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:05,715
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

350
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:08,812
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:13,162
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:15,770
Okay.

353
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,675
You'll call me.

354
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,994
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

355
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,588
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,602
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:34,335
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:36,072
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,443
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

360
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:38,950
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,682
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

362
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,589
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,026
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,325
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,198
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:48,293
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:50,501
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:57,792
Who's gonna come around
when you break?

369
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,763
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:01,890
Witwicky.

371
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,565
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:05,641
You sure?

373
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:07,507
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:11,074
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,318
There you go.

376
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:21,441
So...

377
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,719
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,789
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,924
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:39,273
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:42,375
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:46,017
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:47,690
Big arms?

384
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:52,435
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,034
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:59,577
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:02,461
Yeah.

388
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:09,106
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,041
Oh, no, no.

390
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,049
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,449
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,186
Yeah, a long time.

393
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,192
Well, do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:19,854
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

395
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:23,460
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:24,835
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:28,381
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:30,145
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:31,949
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

400
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,493
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

401
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:38,499
No, no, no. No. Come on.

402
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:42,310
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,877
When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing

404
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,719
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,522
Sexual healing

406
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:52,861
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

407
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:55,940
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,443
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:00,242
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,682
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:07,287
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

413
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:08,893
I feel good

414
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:10,402
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:14,038
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:17,713
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,379
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,892
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

419
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:23,224
Double-pump?

420
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,030
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:29,804
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:33,850
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,786
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:41,925
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:45,476
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

426
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,775
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:48,872
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:50,545
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:53,684
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:56,425
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:59,404
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:01,066
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:04,046
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

434
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,347
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

435
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:09,894
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,763
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,536
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,006
All right.

439
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:22,053
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:25,420
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:28,095
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,037
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

443
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:35,613
Baby come back
any kind of fool could see

444
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:36,978
Hey!

445
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,021
There was something
in everything about you

446
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:46,227
Baby come back
you can blame it all on me

447
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,671
Hey!

448
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,943
Wait a second!

449
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:55,580
I was wrong
and I just can't live without you

450
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:58,754
There it is.

451
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,238
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

452
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:07,977
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,283
I think you're... No, no, no.

454
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:16,998
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:19,941
Okay.

456
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:21,913
Yeah.

457
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:24,541
All right, I'll see you at school.

458
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:25,712
All right.

459
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,102
That's stupid.

460
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:34,462
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:37,375
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,151
Oh, God.

463
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,150
Oh, my God. I love my car.

464
00:27:55,149 --> 00:28:00,718
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

465
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:04,495
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:08,373
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:11,076
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,591
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,756
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,

470
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,064
we'll know just what to do with them.

471
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:23,770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,206
Apparently, there are
very few survivors.

473
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:43,510
Yes, Mr. President?

474
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,557
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:02,782
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,147
Shoot.

477
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:44,869
Gross.

478
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,767
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,307
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,948
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:39,319
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:41,261
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:43,358
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

484
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:56,793
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,424
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:00,401
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:03,033
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:06,345
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:07,977
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:10,821
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:13,695
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,710
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:22,944
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

494
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:25,752
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:25,858 --> 00:31:29,856
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:54,313
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:55,886
What the...

498
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:03,769
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.

499
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:06,708
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

500
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:26,809
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:30,952
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:34,159
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,396
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,204
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

505
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:44,606
That's my car!

506
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:47,385
No!

507
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,620
No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,273
Dad, call the cops!

509
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:05,185
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:09,029
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:12,597
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

512
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,510
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:18,280
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,516
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,361
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,404
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:17,238
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

518
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:19,713
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

519
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,810
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:24,552
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,630
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

522
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:40,452
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:45,367
Oh, my God.

524
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,466
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:49,770
Oh, my God.

526
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:57,791
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

527
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,068
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

528
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:05,508
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:09,753
Listen, listen, listen.

530
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,188
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

531
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,851
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:16,025
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:19,703
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:35,737
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

535
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:38,370
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

536
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,110
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:43,350
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:46,090
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:48,191
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:50,830
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:52,000
It's become the system.

542
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,277
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:56,978
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:59,388
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

545
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:02,431
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,765
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:06,704
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,939
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:13,082
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

550
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:15,819
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,592
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,431
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:23,008
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,443
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:29,043
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:32,525
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:34,895
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,197
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,640
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:42,238
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:44,752
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:48,522
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,559
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:54,003
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

565
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,601
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:56,713 --> 00:38:00,653
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

567
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:09,572
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

568
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:12,844
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:16,080
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,318
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:21,492
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,399
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,837
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:28,310
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

575
00:38:29,113 --> 00:38:31,915
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:35,786
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:39,528
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,774
What was that?

579
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,617
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:54,254
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,568
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:00,207
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:11,030
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:13,573 --> 00:39:16,044
Hey, heads up!

585
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,779
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:26,701
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:33,713
English, dude. English.

588
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,257
Whoa!

589
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:43,425
Watch out!

590
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:52,187
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

591
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:53,347
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,587
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

593
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:06,112
Get up! Get up! Come on!

594
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:15,031
Go! Move it!

595
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,458
Take cover!

596
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,832
Fig! Cover the rear!

597
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:39,386
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:42,517
Come on! Give me a mag!

599
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:45,357
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

600
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:46,560
Papa!

601
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:49,436
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

602
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,911
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

603
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:53,608
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

604
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:54,981
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:56,055
Fire!

606
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,855
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

607
00:40:59,964 --> 00:41:02,457
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,469
I don't have a credit card!

609
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:10,680
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

610
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:13,486
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:17,897
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:20,536
Ammo!

613
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,272
I need a credit card!

614
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,018
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

615
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:31,390
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

616
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:35,699
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,704
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

618
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,806
Okay, it's Visa.

619
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,313
Also, sir, have you heard about

620
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,515
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

621
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:49,761
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

622
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,038
Give me a status.

623
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,008
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

624
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:58,814
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:41:58,921 --> 00:41:59,889
Survivors?

626
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,394
I ain't never seen this in my life!

627
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,233
Need gunships on station ASAP!

628
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:08,534
Predator's coming up in a minute.

629
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:10,042
We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

630
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,297
Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

631
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:22,262
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:32,991
Hey! Make way!

633
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:39,931
- What is that?
- I don't know.

634
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:46,915
We need air support
and we need it now.

635
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,119
Roll in strike package Bravo
on unknown target.

636
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:53,828
I authenticate Tango Whiskey
at time 0300 Zulu.

637
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:56,772
Attention, all aircraft. This will be
a danger close-fire mission.

638
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:58,402
Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.

639
00:42:58,513 --> 00:43:00,210
Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?

640
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:01,842
- Send the Hogs, sir.
- Okay, send the Hogs over

641
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:03,650
to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...

642
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,285
Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
300 feet danger close.

643
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:08,298
Friendlies in the area.

644
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,429
Seven-man team
north of orange smoke!

645
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:14,775
Received Kill Box One Alpha.
Engage hostile.

646
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:20,420
Attack direction west!
You're clear and hot!

647
00:43:23,632 --> 00:43:24,998
Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.

648
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,969
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

649
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:32,442
- Lennox! The heat's coming!
- Laze the target!

650
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:35,114
We got a beam-rider incoming!
Laze target!

651
00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:45,103
- Ready! Heat's coming!
- What? Bring it!

652
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:47,807
Receiving radar jamming
in vicinity of target.

653
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,983
No frigging way
that thing's still not down.

654
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:09,356
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.
Bring the rain.

655
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:15,006
Be advised, ground team is requesting
105 sabot rounds.

656
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,359
Did we lose them?

657
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:47,032
Warthog One confirm visual
on friendlies.

658
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,277
Where's Fig?

659
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:54,814
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!

660
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,591
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!

661
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:58,790
Get a medic!

662
00:44:58,966 --> 00:44:59,991
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

663
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:01,296
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

664
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:03,272
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

665
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,717
Bring them home.

666
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,495
You get those men stateside right now.

667
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,696
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.

668
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:26,856
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

669
00:45:37,313 --> 00:45:40,012
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

670
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,822
I am sorry to bother you.

671
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,759
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

672
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:50,864
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

673
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,638
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

674
00:45:52,745 --> 00:45:54,874
Shut up, Grandma!

675
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:57,420
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

676
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,618
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:46:04,603 --> 00:46:07,131
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

678
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:12,646
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

679
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:19,097
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

680
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,034
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:25,312
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

682
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:27,247
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:29,586
- Please.
- Sorry.

684
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:31,751
Hey, man, save my game.

685
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:33,728
How classified?

686
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:39,133
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,380
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:45,349
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:47,984
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

690
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:49,655
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

691
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,667
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,036
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:55,804
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:02,120
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:04,559
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:06,223
in less than a minute.

697
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,531
- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:14,449
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:22,156
"Project Iceman"?

700
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:25,671
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,545
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,742
Cops! Cops!

703
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:34,552
FBI! Clear right!

704
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:38,493
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:41,173
Cops!

706
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,601
Lock it down.

707
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:46,205
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:50,884
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,622
Especially police!

710
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:55,999
It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago

711
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:59,976
when over 40 C-17 s lifted off
of this very base.

712
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:02,641
We're not told where they're going.

713
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:03,741
Morning, Mo.

714
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:06,154
The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...

715
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,888
- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly

716
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:09,522
towards North Korea.

717
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:12,503
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

718
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:17,878
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

719
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:21,012
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

720
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:24,028
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

721
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:32,938
Stop!

722
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:34,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:42,426
Oh, my God!

724
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,238
Sam?

725
00:48:47,345 --> 00:48:48,314
Hi.

726
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:51,883
That was... That was really awesome.

727
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:54,084
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

728
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:56,186
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

729
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:58,164
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

730
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,501
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

731
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:35,002
Oh, great. Cops.

732
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:41,318
Officer!

733
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:44,727
Listen!

734
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:47,237
Oh, that hurt.

735
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:51,468
Listen to me!

736
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,450
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

737
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:58,220
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

738
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,924
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

739
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:07,503
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

740
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:12,312
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:17,499
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

742
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:24,443
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

743
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:28,188
Okay.

744
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:35,204
Oh, God, no! No!

745
00:50:37,142 --> 00:50:42,586
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

746
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:47,392
It's a bad dream.

747
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:51,033
Are you username LadiesMan217?

748
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:52,300
I don't know what you're talking about!

749
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:54,777
Are you username LadiesMan217?

750
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,007
Yeah.

751
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,552
Where is eBay item 21153?

752
00:50:58,654 --> 00:51:00,351
Where are the glasses?

753
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:13,212
Get back!

754
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,088
Stop!

755
00:51:18,229 --> 00:51:19,197
God!

756
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:21,864
What is your problem, Sam?

757
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,963
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

758
00:51:24,074 --> 00:51:28,516
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

759
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:37,225
Sam, what is that thing?

760
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:38,702
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

761
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,901
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

762
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:45,384
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

763
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,343
Go, go, go, go!

764
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,755
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

765
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,420
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

766
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,830
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:10,870
Oh, my God! No!

768
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:12,271
We're gonna die!

769
00:52:18,322 --> 00:52:19,688
Oh, my God!

770
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:38,255
We're locked in.

771
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:44,208
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

772
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:51,215
Okay.

773
00:52:52,827 --> 00:52:54,261
Time to start.

774
00:53:58,698 --> 00:53:59,997
He's got me! Oh, God!

775
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:08,416
He's going to kill me!

776
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,222
No. No, no, no!

777
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:29,022
Get off!

778
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:44,718
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:46,389
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

780
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:55,217
Not so tough without a head, are you?

781
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:02,631
Here, come on.

782
00:55:17,497 --> 00:55:18,966
What is it?

783
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,805
It's a robot.

784
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:24,508
But like a...

785
00:55:24,646 --> 00:55:28,142
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:30,957
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:33,462
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:36,764
What are you doing?

789
00:55:37,406 --> 00:55:40,573
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,980
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

791
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:46,489
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

792
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:51,028
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

793
00:55:51,135 --> 00:55:53,629
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

794
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:57,276
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:57,783 --> 00:55:59,946
- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...

796
00:56:00,054 --> 00:56:03,619
Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...

797
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:05,493
So you... You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:05,598 --> 00:56:08,502
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

799
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:10,598
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:12,177
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

801
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,341
Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...

802
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:16,421
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

803
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:18,651
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,889
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

805
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:29,203
Any more questions you want to ask?

806
00:56:29,883 --> 00:56:32,046
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,558
And go where?

808
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:37,326
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

809
00:56:37,465 --> 00:56:40,529
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:11,765
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:13,032
I know.

812
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:17,683
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

813
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:19,980
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

814
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,147
Yeah.

815
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:24,063
You're right.

816
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,573
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

817
00:57:29,742 --> 00:57:33,512
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

818
00:57:35,587 --> 00:57:36,988
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

819
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:38,651
- Yeah.
- Okay.

820
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:43,126
There, see? That's better.

821
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:44,837
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,918
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

823
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:53,959
Thank you.

824
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:57,158
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,330
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

826
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,037
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,780
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:08,652
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

829
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:09,816
Move it, you moron!

830
00:58:09,926 --> 00:58:11,953
Great, now... See?

831
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:14,494
Fantastic.

832
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:16,469
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:18,242
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:20,542
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

835
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:34,803
What?

836
00:59:38,646 --> 00:59:40,012
This is you...

837
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:47,061
Oh, my God!

838
00:59:54,312 --> 00:59:56,009
Come on, let's go.

839
01:00:00,926 --> 01:00:04,127
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:07,695
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!

841
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,037
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

842
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,670
Whoa! Sweet!

843
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:27,907
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

844
01:00:28,016 --> 01:00:29,280
'cause he is so boned!

845
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:34,526
What is that?

846
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,658
There's something in the tree, dude.

847
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:38,897
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

848
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:40,339
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:15,783 --> 01:01:18,277
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

850
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:22,895
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
01:01:22,998 --> 01:01:25,492
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:58,132 --> 01:03:02,334
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:03:03,509 --> 01:03:04,979
They know your name.

854
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:05,274
They know your name.

855
01:03:06,214 --> 01:03:07,183
Yeah.

856
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,720
My name is Optimus Prime.

857
01:03:09,822 --> 01:03:13,888
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

858
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,369
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

859
01:03:17,572 --> 01:03:22,845
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

860
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:26,481
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

861
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:28,925
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

862
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:32,629
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

863
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,611
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

864
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:41,079
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

865
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:44,423
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

866
01:03:45,664 --> 01:03:47,827
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

867
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:52,070
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

868
01:03:54,483 --> 01:03:57,819
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

869
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,720
Bumblebee, right?

870
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:01,524
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none

871
01:04:01,632 --> 01:04:04,000
So you're my guardian, huh?

872
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:09,308
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

873
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:15,524
Why are you here?

874
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:20,866
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

875
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:22,641
Mega-what?

876
01:04:32,229 --> 01:04:37,832
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,

877
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:43,750
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

878
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:48,124
All who defied them were destroyed.

879
01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:54,334
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

880
01:04:55,311 --> 01:05:01,313
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.

881
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:04,189
My grandfather.

882
01:05:04,297 --> 01:05:08,499
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.

883
01:05:11,712 --> 01:05:13,271
Come back!

884
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,383
I think the dogs have found something.

885
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:21,226
The ice is cracking!

886
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:33,648
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

887
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,386
I'm all right, lads!

888
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,197
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

889
01:05:47,587 --> 01:05:52,690
Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.

890
01:05:56,272 --> 01:05:59,734
Men! We've made a discovery!

891
01:05:59,846 --> 01:06:04,254
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

892
01:06:17,851 --> 01:06:23,693
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

893
01:06:23,796 --> 01:06:25,823
How'd you know about his glasses?

894
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:28,167
- EBay.
- EBay.

895
01:06:28,272 --> 01:06:31,439
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

896
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:37,388
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

897
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:40,897
And the human race
will be extinguished.

898
01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:46,466
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

899
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:52,656
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

900
01:06:56,598 --> 01:07:00,038
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

901
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:02,132
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

902
01:07:02,243 --> 01:07:03,507
Melted right through.

903
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:06,813
Hey, aren't sabots hot-Ioaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

904
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:09,151
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

905
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:11,456
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

906
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,858
- Heads up!
- Oh!

907
01:07:14,603 --> 01:07:17,268
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

908
01:07:17,676 --> 01:07:21,412
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

909
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:22,850
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

910
01:07:22,954 --> 01:07:25,221
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

911
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:26,794
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

912
01:07:32,035 --> 01:07:33,732
You want that piece?

913
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,142
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

914
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:39,308
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

915
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:42,754
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

916
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,421
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

917
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:48,001
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

918
01:07:48,103 --> 01:07:51,941
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

919
01:07:52,044 --> 01:07:53,206
It's me and you.

920
01:07:53,314 --> 01:07:56,150
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

921
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:13,245
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

922
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:14,985
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

923
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:17,086
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

924
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:18,165
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

925
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:20,499
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

926
01:08:20,604 --> 01:08:25,308
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

927
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:26,382
Okay, so what?

928
01:08:26,483 --> 01:08:28,579
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

929
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,385
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

930
01:08:30,492 --> 01:08:31,460
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

931
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:35,399
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

932
01:08:37,707 --> 01:08:39,802
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

933
01:08:39,911 --> 01:08:41,505
See? So can I go home now?

934
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:43,847
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

935
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,655
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

936
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:50,096
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

937
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:53,798
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

938
01:08:53,907 --> 01:08:55,638
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

939
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:58,045
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

940
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,986
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...

941
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:02,683
- What did he say?
- What?

942
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:04,262
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

943
01:09:04,363 --> 01:09:06,926
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

944
01:09:07,035 --> 01:09:08,435
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

945
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,649
Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...

946
01:09:15,754 --> 01:09:16,949
- Yeah!
- Call Sam.

947
01:09:17,056 --> 01:09:18,616
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

948
01:09:18,726 --> 01:09:20,024
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

949
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,657
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

950
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:24,397
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

951
01:09:29,683 --> 01:09:31,117
I need you to stay here, all right?

952
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,381
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

953
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:33,457
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

954
01:09:33,557 --> 01:09:34,547
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

955
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:35,627
Five minutes, all right?

956
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:39,302
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

957
01:09:39,403 --> 01:09:41,373
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

958
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:43,103
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

959
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:45,511
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

960
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:49,283
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

961
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:50,950
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

962
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,931
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

963
01:09:54,034 --> 01:09:56,597
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

964
01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:57,799
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

965
01:09:57,909 --> 01:09:59,378
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

966
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:00,947
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

967
01:10:01,048 --> 01:10:02,415
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

968
01:10:02,518 --> 01:10:03,747
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

969
01:10:03,854 --> 01:10:05,757
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

970
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:09,731
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

971
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,202
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

972
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:13,274
The...

973
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:17,716
I love you. God, I love you

974
01:10:17,817 --> 01:10:19,548
just so much right now.

975
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:21,088
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

976
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:22,716
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

977
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:24,660
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

978
01:10:24,765 --> 01:10:26,131
because you're such a swell guy.

979
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:27,362
One more thing, huh?

980
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:30,534
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

981
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:32,740
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

982
01:10:32,881 --> 01:10:36,150
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

983
01:10:36,256 --> 01:10:39,126
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

984
01:10:39,228 --> 01:10:41,665
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

985
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:43,737
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

986
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:46,675
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

987
01:10:49,951 --> 01:10:51,944
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

988
01:10:52,056 --> 01:10:56,053
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

989
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:59,735
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

990
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,867
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

991
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:05,746
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

992
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:08,652
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

993
01:11:08,757 --> 01:11:11,729
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

994
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:13,026
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

995
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:15,296
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

996
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,605
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

997
01:11:18,712 --> 01:11:21,411
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

998
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:27,089
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

999
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:28,688
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1000
01:11:28,799 --> 01:11:30,359
That's all it is.

1001
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,271
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1002
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:35,678
Okay, okay.

1003
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:39,514
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1004
01:11:42,728 --> 01:11:44,288
Autobots, recon.

1005
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:48,833
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1006
01:11:48,941 --> 01:11:50,706
Got some ice on his nose.

1007
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:53,249
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1008
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,718
You did not.

1009
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,119
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1010
01:11:58,862 --> 01:12:01,425
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1011
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:05,134
Come on, come on.

1012
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:13,050
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1013
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:15,756
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1014
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,528
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:17,635 --> 01:12:19,628
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1016
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:23,002
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1017
01:12:23,113 --> 01:12:24,138
My glasses were in the bag.

1018
01:12:24,249 --> 01:12:26,082
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1019
01:12:26,186 --> 01:12:27,746
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1020
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:28,916
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1021
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:31,223
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1022
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:34,269
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1023
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:36,807
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1024
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,344
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1025
01:12:38,446 --> 01:12:39,414
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1026
01:12:39,515 --> 01:12:40,881
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1027
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:43,684
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1028
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,726
I'm already stressed out enough.

1029
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,320
Okay. What now?

1030
01:12:49,736 --> 01:12:53,176
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1031
01:12:53,277 --> 01:12:57,240
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1032
01:12:57,352 --> 01:12:58,342
Oh, God. Oh!

1033
01:12:58,454 --> 01:13:02,588
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.

1034
01:13:02,696 --> 01:13:04,997
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1035
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:08,202
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1036
01:13:08,309 --> 01:13:11,247
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1037
01:13:11,348 --> 01:13:12,942
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1038
01:13:13,052 --> 01:13:14,111
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1039
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,450
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1040
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,550
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1041
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:19,130
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1042
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:20,790
We must have the glasses.

1043
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,461
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1044
01:13:22,571 --> 01:13:24,804
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1045
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,003
Keep searching.

1046
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:27,775
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1047
01:13:27,882 --> 01:13:29,112
Ten minutes. Okay?

1048
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:30,984
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1049
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,083
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1050
01:13:33,194 --> 01:13:34,219
Calm down, calm down.

1051
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:36,026
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1052
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:38,798
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1053
01:13:38,905 --> 01:13:40,772
Good? Good? Okay.

1054
01:13:40,877 --> 01:13:42,038
- Move!
- Get away!

1055
01:13:42,146 --> 01:13:43,843
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1056
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,852
He wants us to be quiet.

1057
01:13:49,695 --> 01:13:53,499
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1058
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:54,304
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1059
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:57,471
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1060
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:59,411
How did you get over there so fast?

1061
01:14:00,484 --> 01:14:02,249
Wow! That was tingly!

1062
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:05,760
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1063
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:12,633
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1064
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:17,747
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1065
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:20,892
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1066
01:14:21,032 --> 01:14:22,728
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1067
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,397
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1068
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:26,565
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1069
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,577
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1070
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:29,840
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1071
01:14:29,948 --> 01:14:31,006
How come the door's locked?

1072
01:14:31,116 --> 01:14:34,748
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1073
01:14:34,856 --> 01:14:36,051
You know he'll start counting

1074
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,560
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1075
01:14:37,662 --> 01:14:38,652
Oh, dear.

1076
01:14:38,764 --> 01:14:40,493
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1077
01:14:40,633 --> 01:14:42,000
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1078
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,071
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1079
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:45,233
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1080
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:49,409
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1081
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:52,511
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1082
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:54,216
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1083
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:56,557
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1084
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:58,530
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1085
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:00,432
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1086
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,029
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1087
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:03,403
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1088
01:15:03,509 --> 01:15:05,536
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1089
01:15:05,646 --> 01:15:07,012
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1090
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:08,140
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1091
01:15:08,252 --> 01:15:09,618
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1092
01:15:09,721 --> 01:15:11,189
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1093
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,724
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1094
01:15:12,826 --> 01:15:15,194
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1095
01:15:15,298 --> 01:15:19,760
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1096
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:22,702
- Judy.
- Was I...

1097
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:23,780
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1098
01:15:23,881 --> 01:15:25,212
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1099
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:26,341
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1100
01:15:26,452 --> 01:15:27,977
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1101
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:30,924
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1102
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:34,659
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1103
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:36,759
- Happy time?
...my special alone time...

1104
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,838
- Stop.
- Mom.

1105
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:38,930
- Judy, stop.
...with myself.

1106
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:40,066
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1107
01:15:40,177 --> 01:15:42,477
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1108
01:15:42,582 --> 01:15:44,608
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1109
01:15:44,718 --> 01:15:46,483
Oh, parents.

1110
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:50,191
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1111
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:54,894
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1112
01:15:55,003 --> 01:15:57,275
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1113
01:15:57,275 --> 01:15:57,639
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1114
01:15:57,742 --> 01:15:58,732
Oh, I hate these.

1115
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,109
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1116
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:01,239
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1117
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,874
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1118
01:16:02,985 --> 01:16:04,318
Can't you take safety seriously?

1119
01:16:04,422 --> 01:16:07,690
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1120
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:10,698
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1121
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:19,304
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1122
01:16:19,415 --> 01:16:21,909
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1123
01:16:22,021 --> 01:16:24,254
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1124
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,054
Trashed. Gone.

1125
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:27,830
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1126
01:16:27,932 --> 01:16:29,959
The parents are very irritating.

1127
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:31,766
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1128
01:16:31,872 --> 01:16:34,604
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1129
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:35,905
What is with you?

1130
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:39,349
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1131
01:16:39,452 --> 01:16:41,115
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1132
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:43,625
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1133
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:45,526
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1134
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,565
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1135
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:52,772
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1136
01:16:52,878 --> 01:16:55,747
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1137
01:16:55,849 --> 01:16:58,912
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1138
01:16:59,022 --> 01:17:00,513
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1139
01:17:00,626 --> 01:17:01,786
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1140
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:22,495
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1141
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:24,591
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1142
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:25,670
I want you to distract my parents

1143
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,072
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1144
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,583
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1145
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:38,718
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1146
01:17:38,828 --> 01:17:40,957
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1147
01:17:41,066 --> 01:17:43,594
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1148
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:44,832
It's Witwicky.

1149
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,173
May I enter the premises, sir?

1150
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:51,217
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1151
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:52,286
What the heck is going on here?

1152
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:54,516
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1153
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,891
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1154
01:17:56,996 --> 01:17:58,430
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1155
01:17:58,532 --> 01:17:59,592
That's right. National security.

1156
01:17:59,702 --> 01:18:01,294
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1157
01:18:01,404 --> 01:18:03,771
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1158
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:05,673
Could you stay off the grass?

1159
01:18:05,778 --> 01:18:07,213
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1160
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:08,943
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1161
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:12,284
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1162
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:13,859
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1163
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,293
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1164
01:18:15,397 --> 01:18:16,728
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1165
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:18,996
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1166
01:18:19,104 --> 01:18:22,132
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1167
01:18:22,242 --> 01:18:24,303
- No!
- What is this?

1168
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,146
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1169
01:18:27,252 --> 01:18:28,720
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1170
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:30,050
Whoa, way out of line.

1171
01:18:30,157 --> 01:18:34,188
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1172
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:36,199
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1173
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:37,360
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1174
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:38,665
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1175
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:40,970
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1176
01:18:41,077 --> 01:18:43,776
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1177
01:18:43,883 --> 01:18:47,845
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1178
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:50,188
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1179
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:52,855
I think direct contact.

1180
01:18:58,309 --> 01:18:59,869
- Son?
- Yeah.

1181
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:03,850
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1182
01:19:09,629 --> 01:19:11,097
Fourteen rads.

1183
01:19:12,702 --> 01:19:14,171
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1184
01:19:14,906 --> 01:19:16,807
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1185
01:19:16,909 --> 01:19:18,606
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1186
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:20,238
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1187
01:19:20,349 --> 01:19:22,217
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1188
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:27,655
So,

1189
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:32,560
LadiesMan217.

1190
01:19:32,672 --> 01:19:36,111
That is your eBay username, right?

1191
01:19:36,212 --> 01:19:38,546
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1192
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:39,618
What do you make of this?

1193
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:42,281
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...

1194
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:43,517
Is that you?

1195
01:19:43,626 --> 01:19:45,823
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1196
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:50,769
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1197
01:19:52,108 --> 01:19:54,442
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1198
01:19:54,545 --> 01:19:59,009
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1199
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:01,250
- Really?
...from me, from my home,

1200
01:20:01,358 --> 01:20:04,330
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1201
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:06,161
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1202
01:20:06,267 --> 01:20:09,706
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1203
01:20:12,846 --> 01:20:14,439
That's funny. That is so funny.

1204
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:17,042
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1205
01:20:18,222 --> 01:20:20,989
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T.? No.

1206
01:20:21,095 --> 01:20:22,585
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1207
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:23,824
You see this?

1208
01:20:23,933 --> 01:20:26,529
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1209
01:20:26,638 --> 01:20:29,405
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1210
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:30,738
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1211
01:20:30,845 --> 01:20:33,248
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1212
01:20:33,351 --> 01:20:36,414
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1213
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:38,617
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1214
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:40,127
What? Parole?

1215
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:43,566
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1216
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,662
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1217
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,503
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1218
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,703
You stole cars?

1219
01:20:48,812 --> 01:20:50,509
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1220
01:20:50,616 --> 01:20:52,414
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1221
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:54,819
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1222
01:20:54,923 --> 01:20:57,554
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1223
01:20:58,698 --> 01:21:03,331
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1224
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:05,740
It is time to talk!

1225
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:13,923
Big! It's big!

1226
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:20,637
Go, go, go, go!

1227
01:21:21,072 --> 01:21:23,702
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1228
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,245
All right! All right!

1229
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,141
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1230
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:48,780
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1231
01:21:51,026 --> 01:21:54,796
Taking the children was a bad move.

1232
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:58,305
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1233
01:22:01,913 --> 01:22:03,644
Freeze!

1234
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:05,686
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1235
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:06,846
Whoa!

1236
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,351
Whoa!

1237
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:21,479
Hi, there.

1238
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:26,521
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1239
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:32,169
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1240
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,069
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1241
01:22:34,173 --> 01:22:36,404
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1242
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:39,107
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1243
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,876
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1244
01:22:40,985 --> 01:22:42,477
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1245
01:22:42,589 --> 01:22:45,959
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1246
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:49,557
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1247
01:22:49,668 --> 01:22:51,193
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1248
01:22:51,304 --> 01:22:52,294
How you doing?

1249
01:22:52,406 --> 01:22:54,137
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1250
01:22:54,244 --> 01:22:56,407
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1251
01:22:56,515 --> 01:22:59,679
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1252
01:22:59,786 --> 01:23:03,556
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1253
01:23:04,162 --> 01:23:08,329
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1254
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:11,568
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1255
01:23:11,676 --> 01:23:14,544
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1256
01:23:14,648 --> 01:23:17,141
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1257
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:19,485
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1258
01:23:19,591 --> 01:23:21,582
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1259
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:23,560
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1260
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:25,395
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1261
01:23:25,502 --> 01:23:28,337
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1262
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,639
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1263
01:23:36,922 --> 01:23:37,889
Hey!

1264
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:40,928
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1265
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,090
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1266
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,738
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1267
01:23:47,842 --> 01:23:50,540
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1268
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:53,615
For threatening my dad.

1269
01:23:56,692 --> 01:24:02,601
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1270
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,035
You're a criminal.

1271
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,511
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1272
01:24:10,985 --> 01:24:13,820
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1273
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:14,913
All right.

1274
01:24:15,025 --> 01:24:17,120
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1275
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,068
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1276
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:23,366
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1277
01:24:23,474 --> 01:24:24,738
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1278
01:24:24,844 --> 01:24:29,284
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1279
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,766
Optimus! Incoming!

1280
01:24:45,482 --> 01:24:46,711
Roll out.

1281
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,965
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.

1282
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:03,246
Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.

1283
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:04,680
Up you get.

1284
01:25:09,392 --> 01:25:11,362
Okay, we're dropping in.

1285
01:25:15,404 --> 01:25:17,999
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.

1286
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:20,271
Ship one and two, come on in.

1287
01:25:21,348 --> 01:25:23,979
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.

1288
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:27,354
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.

1289
01:25:27,893 --> 01:25:29,453
I got it. 12:00.

1290
01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:34,971
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1291
01:25:37,945 --> 01:25:40,143
Got him going down the street.

1292
01:25:43,756 --> 01:25:48,323
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1293
01:25:48,664 --> 01:25:50,828
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1294
01:25:51,403 --> 01:25:53,396
Okay, we're coming around.

1295
01:26:16,115 --> 01:26:17,641
Easy, you two.

1296
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:30,269
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1297
01:26:30,943 --> 01:26:33,937
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1298
01:26:35,183 --> 01:26:37,245
- Hold on!
- No!

1299
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:42,190
Sam!

1300
01:26:47,807 --> 01:26:50,938
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.

1301
01:26:51,047 --> 01:26:52,310
I'm in for the shot.

1302
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,850
Stop! Stop!

1303
01:26:55,054 --> 01:26:56,852
Wait! No!

1304
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,825
- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.

1305
01:27:03,402 --> 01:27:04,597
No!

1306
01:27:20,701 --> 01:27:22,796
No! Stop!

1307
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:24,705
Stop!

1308
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:28,748
Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!

1309
01:27:29,752 --> 01:27:31,084
What? Okay.

1310
01:27:32,957 --> 01:27:35,119
Look, he's not fighting back!

1311
01:27:35,728 --> 01:27:37,926
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1312
01:27:44,311 --> 01:27:45,870
Stop hurting him!

1313
01:27:55,298 --> 01:27:56,995
Don't let him move!

1314
01:27:57,736 --> 01:27:59,295
I got him here!

1315
01:28:22,516 --> 01:28:23,575
No!

1316
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:29,390
Happy to see me again?

1317
01:28:30,898 --> 01:28:33,629
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1318
01:28:39,512 --> 01:28:42,575
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1319
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:53,033
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1320
01:28:55,876 --> 01:28:57,276
Optimus,

1321
01:28:59,617 --> 01:29:02,086
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1322
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:05,887
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1323
01:29:05,995 --> 01:29:08,796
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1324
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:23,190
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1325
01:29:23,294 --> 01:29:24,420
in the western Pacific.

1326
01:29:24,529 --> 01:29:26,726
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1327
01:29:26,834 --> 01:29:29,600
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1328
01:29:33,946 --> 01:29:36,817
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1329
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,251
of cruise missile range.

1330
01:29:38,355 --> 01:29:41,885
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1331
01:29:41,995 --> 01:29:43,965
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1332
01:29:46,369 --> 01:29:51,438
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1333
01:29:51,546 --> 01:29:54,744
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1334
01:29:57,891 --> 01:30:00,384
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1335
01:30:04,035 --> 01:30:06,700
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1336
01:30:06,808 --> 01:30:09,209
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1337
01:30:09,311 --> 01:30:10,973
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1338
01:30:11,081 --> 01:30:13,518
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1339
01:30:14,555 --> 01:30:15,523
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1340
01:30:15,624 --> 01:30:18,618
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1341
01:30:18,729 --> 01:30:19,822
The blackout's global.

1342
01:30:19,931 --> 01:30:22,767
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1343
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:27,401
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1344
01:30:33,356 --> 01:30:37,660
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1345
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:42,036
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1346
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:46,670
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1347
01:30:46,781 --> 01:30:48,876
you won't understand right away.

1348
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:52,321
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1349
01:30:52,425 --> 01:30:55,829
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1350
01:30:56,699 --> 01:31:00,798
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1351
01:31:01,908 --> 01:31:06,179
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1352
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:09,052
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1353
01:31:09,656 --> 01:31:12,184
This was classified above top secret.

1354
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:29,820
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1355
01:31:29,928 --> 01:31:32,557
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1356
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,929
This is the image from Mars.

1357
01:31:36,774 --> 01:31:39,540
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1358
01:31:39,644 --> 01:31:41,409
from the base attack.

1359
01:31:42,183 --> 01:31:45,279
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1360
01:31:46,157 --> 01:31:48,923
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1361
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:51,994
Are we talking about an invasion?

1362
01:31:52,102 --> 01:31:55,198
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1363
01:31:55,307 --> 01:31:58,643
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1364
01:31:58,747 --> 01:32:00,477
That's why the virus shut us down,

1365
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,885
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1366
01:32:03,991 --> 01:32:08,488
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1367
01:32:12,372 --> 01:32:14,705
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1368
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:18,213
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1369
01:32:18,316 --> 01:32:21,652
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1370
01:32:21,756 --> 01:32:24,727
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1371
01:32:34,947 --> 01:32:38,213
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1372
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:39,287
Let's go!

1373
01:32:44,331 --> 01:32:45,822
She's in here.

1374
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,863
What's going on?

1375
01:32:48,405 --> 01:32:50,238
You're coming with me.

1376
01:32:50,676 --> 01:32:53,373
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

1377
01:32:54,382 --> 01:32:55,715
Who's this?

1378
01:32:56,486 --> 01:32:59,583
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

1379
01:33:10,879 --> 01:33:13,373
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1380
01:33:14,452 --> 01:33:18,722
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1381
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:19,795
Wow.

1382
01:33:20,464 --> 01:33:21,590
Who knew?

1383
01:33:38,397 --> 01:33:40,299
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1384
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,853
Please, let this work.

1385
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:57,163
Fire it up, Optimus.

1386
01:33:58,134 --> 01:33:59,624
The code.

1387
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:05,145
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1388
01:34:06,949 --> 01:34:10,753
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1389
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:13,689
They must know it's here, as well.

1390
01:34:13,796 --> 01:34:15,127
What about Bumblebee?

1391
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:19,297
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1392
01:34:19,406 --> 01:34:23,401
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1393
01:34:23,513 --> 01:34:27,750
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1394
01:34:27,855 --> 01:34:30,792
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1395
01:34:32,196 --> 01:34:35,566
They're a primitive and violent race.

1396
01:34:37,907 --> 01:34:39,899
Were we so different?

1397
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:45,184
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.

1398
01:34:45,287 --> 01:34:48,087
But I've seen goodness in them.

1399
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:52,359
Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.

1400
01:34:52,466 --> 01:34:56,702
You all know there's only one way
to end this war.

1401
01:34:56,808 --> 01:34:59,506
We must destroy the Cube.

1402
01:35:00,315 --> 01:35:04,881
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1403
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:06,321
That's suicide.

1404
01:35:06,426 --> 01:35:10,230
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1405
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:14,797
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1406
01:35:14,908 --> 01:35:18,211
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1407
01:35:19,684 --> 01:35:22,381
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1408
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:26,292
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1409
01:35:38,351 --> 01:35:41,517
Team attention! Present arms!

1410
01:35:42,192 --> 01:35:46,427
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1411
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:48,230
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1412
01:35:48,337 --> 01:35:50,465
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1413
01:35:50,573 --> 01:35:51,837
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1414
01:35:51,943 --> 01:35:55,039
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1415
01:35:56,552 --> 01:35:57,780
Hey, kid.

1416
01:35:58,855 --> 01:36:01,519
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1417
01:36:02,062 --> 01:36:03,155
You must be hungry?

1418
01:36:03,264 --> 01:36:05,256
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1419
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:06,996
Where's my car?

1420
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:10,668
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1421
01:36:11,179 --> 01:36:12,875
People can die here.

1422
01:36:13,248 --> 01:36:15,947
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1423
01:36:16,054 --> 01:36:17,250
Okay.

1424
01:36:17,356 --> 01:36:21,090
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1425
01:36:21,197 --> 01:36:25,900
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1426
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:30,513
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1427
01:36:30,614 --> 01:36:31,913
Thank you.

1428
01:36:33,386 --> 01:36:35,115
The man's an extortionist.

1429
01:36:36,859 --> 01:36:38,192
All right, here's the situation.

1430
01:36:38,295 --> 01:36:40,697
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1431
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:41,892
NBEs?

1432
01:36:42,001 --> 01:36:45,600
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1433
01:36:45,709 --> 01:36:49,341
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1434
01:36:58,532 --> 01:36:59,100
Dear God. What is this?

1435
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,363
Dear God. What is this?

1436
01:37:01,939 --> 01:37:05,206
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1437
01:37:05,312 --> 01:37:08,750
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1438
01:37:08,851 --> 01:37:12,848
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1439
01:37:12,959 --> 01:37:16,227
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1440
01:37:16,332 --> 01:37:18,734
We call him NBE One.

1441
01:37:18,836 --> 01:37:21,205
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1442
01:37:21,308 --> 01:37:23,710
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1443
01:37:24,981 --> 01:37:26,813
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1444
01:37:26,917 --> 01:37:30,254
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1445
01:37:30,358 --> 01:37:33,818
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1446
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:35,365
in the history of mankind.

1447
01:37:35,467 --> 01:37:38,405
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1448
01:37:38,506 --> 01:37:45,350
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1449
01:37:45,453 --> 01:37:49,255
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1450
01:37:49,827 --> 01:37:52,457
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1451
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:54,934
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1452
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:59,033
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1453
01:37:59,144 --> 01:38:01,011
Well, you got one now.

1454
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,351
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1455
01:38:04,453 --> 01:38:05,978
All Spark? What is that?

1456
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:08,652
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-Iooking thing.

1457
01:38:08,762 --> 01:38:13,533
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1458
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:16,073
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1459
01:38:16,176 --> 01:38:19,272
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1460
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:20,906
That's their plan.

1461
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:23,420
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1462
01:38:25,759 --> 01:38:28,025
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1463
01:38:29,466 --> 01:38:30,593
Follow me.

1464
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:36,734
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1465
01:38:45,696 --> 01:38:49,260
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1466
01:38:50,171 --> 01:38:53,803
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1467
01:38:54,646 --> 01:38:58,517
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1468
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,146
as well as NBE One.

1469
01:39:00,257 --> 01:39:02,818
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1470
01:39:02,927 --> 01:39:05,296
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1471
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,736
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1472
01:39:08,839 --> 01:39:12,437
or any alien species on the outside.

1473
01:39:51,283 --> 01:39:55,087
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1474
01:39:55,725 --> 01:39:58,218
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1475
01:40:02,805 --> 01:40:05,675
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1476
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:13,251
Oh, wow.

1477
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:15,385
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1478
01:40:15,495 --> 01:40:16,690
Oh, no, man.

1479
01:40:16,831 --> 01:40:21,295
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1480
01:40:21,407 --> 01:40:24,344
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1481
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:28,910
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1482
01:40:29,021 --> 01:40:30,454
I got a phone.

1483
01:40:33,662 --> 01:40:36,259
Nokias are real nasty.

1484
01:40:36,367 --> 01:40:40,807
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1485
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,739
Nokia's from Finland.

1486
01:40:43,847 --> 01:40:48,412
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1487
01:40:51,194 --> 01:40:56,761
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1488
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:13,765
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1489
01:41:13,869 --> 01:41:17,535
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1490
01:41:28,562 --> 01:41:30,430
He's breaking the box.

1491
01:41:48,433 --> 01:41:49,561
Go! Go! Go!

1492
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:50,762
Move!

1493
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,949
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1494
01:42:02,726 --> 01:42:04,059
Banachek. What's going on?

1495
01:42:04,162 --> 01:42:05,995
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1496
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,159
- What?
...and the backup generator

1497
01:42:07,268 --> 01:42:09,236
- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?

1498
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,413
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1499
01:42:17,519 --> 01:42:18,920
I'll bring security to the...

1500
01:42:19,022 --> 01:42:21,550
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1501
01:42:21,661 --> 01:42:23,254
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1502
01:42:23,364 --> 01:42:24,730
Let's go!

1503
01:42:24,832 --> 01:42:26,597
They're popping our generators!

1504
01:42:38,626 --> 01:42:39,992
Megatron melting!

1505
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:43,692
16502. We're losing pressure.

1506
01:42:43,802 --> 01:42:45,999
Stand by! Set!

1507
01:42:46,106 --> 01:42:48,167
We're losing pressure!

1508
01:42:48,277 --> 01:42:51,716
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!

1509
01:42:56,459 --> 01:42:59,157
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1510
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:03,260
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1511
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:11,445
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1512
01:43:11,553 --> 01:43:12,578
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1513
01:43:12,689 --> 01:43:14,624
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1514
01:43:14,725 --> 01:43:16,455
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1515
01:43:16,561 --> 01:43:17,825
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1516
01:43:17,931 --> 01:43:19,297
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1517
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:21,394
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1518
01:43:21,506 --> 01:43:23,235
Take him to his car!

1519
01:43:24,978 --> 01:43:26,173
Drop it.

1520
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:29,613
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1521
01:43:30,888 --> 01:43:32,881
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1522
01:43:33,393 --> 01:43:35,124
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1523
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:36,255
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1524
01:43:36,366 --> 01:43:38,562
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1525
01:43:38,669 --> 01:43:39,830
S-Seven don't exist.

1526
01:43:39,938 --> 01:43:41,703
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1527
01:43:41,808 --> 01:43:45,076
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1528
01:43:47,686 --> 01:43:49,315
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1529
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:53,487
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1530
01:43:58,005 --> 01:43:59,974
All right. Okay.

1531
01:44:00,075 --> 01:44:04,709
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1532
01:44:08,157 --> 01:44:09,421
No, no!

1533
01:44:10,395 --> 01:44:13,059
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1534
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:16,731
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1535
01:44:17,942 --> 01:44:19,342
Are you okay?

1536
01:44:21,215 --> 01:44:23,309
They didn't hurt you, right?

1537
01:44:32,068 --> 01:44:35,871
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1538
01:44:38,278 --> 01:44:40,374
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1539
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:42,716
They're not gonna hurt you.

1540
01:44:42,821 --> 01:44:46,350
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1541
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:49,729
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1542
01:44:49,834 --> 01:44:51,326
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1543
01:45:13,411 --> 01:45:16,905
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1544
01:45:37,054 --> 01:45:38,387
Oh, my God.

1545
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:44,599
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1546
01:45:44,702 --> 01:45:46,102
Let's get to it.

1547
01:45:46,204 --> 01:45:49,233
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1548
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:50,744
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1549
01:45:50,846 --> 01:45:52,144
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1550
01:45:52,249 --> 01:45:53,649
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1551
01:45:53,752 --> 01:45:54,720
Good! Right.

1552
01:45:54,821 --> 01:45:57,553
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1553
01:45:57,659 --> 01:45:59,719
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1554
01:45:59,829 --> 01:46:01,696
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1555
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:04,397
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1556
01:46:04,505 --> 01:46:05,938
In the alien archive, sir!

1557
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,033
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1558
01:46:08,144 --> 01:46:09,670
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1559
01:46:09,781 --> 01:46:12,218
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1560
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,083
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1561
01:46:14,189 --> 01:46:15,818
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1562
01:46:15,926 --> 01:46:17,896
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1563
01:46:17,996 --> 01:46:19,522
Affirmative!

1564
01:46:19,633 --> 01:46:23,469
Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.

1565
01:46:24,474 --> 01:46:26,341
Check that backup system!

1566
01:46:26,446 --> 01:46:30,612
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1567
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,211
Come on! Get out of here!

1568
01:46:32,323 --> 01:46:33,849
Heads up! Look out!

1569
01:46:34,862 --> 01:46:37,264
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1570
01:46:37,366 --> 01:46:40,804
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1571
01:46:50,522 --> 01:46:53,585
I am Megatron!

1572
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:13,830
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1573
01:47:13,933 --> 01:47:14,923
Well, put the seat belt on.

1574
01:47:15,035 --> 01:47:16,196
Pour it on him!

1575
01:47:29,963 --> 01:47:31,956
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1576
01:47:32,067 --> 01:47:34,470
Where is the Cube?

1577
01:47:34,572 --> 01:47:36,631
The humans have taken it.

1578
01:47:40,015 --> 01:47:43,885
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1579
01:47:44,321 --> 01:47:45,790
Come on, Mags!

1580
01:47:46,893 --> 01:47:48,385
Over here, sir!

1581
01:47:50,734 --> 01:47:52,795
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1582
01:47:52,904 --> 01:47:55,341
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1583
01:47:57,246 --> 01:48:00,706
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1584
01:48:01,755 --> 01:48:02,745
Mikes?

1585
01:48:02,857 --> 01:48:04,120
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1586
01:48:04,226 --> 01:48:05,785
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1587
01:48:05,895 --> 01:48:07,421
Let's find them.

1588
01:48:07,532 --> 01:48:09,000
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1589
01:48:09,101 --> 01:48:11,264
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1590
01:48:11,372 --> 01:48:14,435
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1591
01:48:14,545 --> 01:48:15,843
- Glen?
- Huh?

1592
01:48:15,946 --> 01:48:19,441
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1593
01:48:19,553 --> 01:48:20,543
What good is that?

1594
01:48:20,655 --> 01:48:23,058
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1595
01:48:23,161 --> 01:48:26,725
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1596
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:28,666
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1597
01:48:40,459 --> 01:48:41,984
There's Optimus.

1598
01:48:59,962 --> 01:49:01,430
Almost done.

1599
01:49:03,268 --> 01:49:05,168
What the hell was that?

1600
01:49:08,244 --> 01:49:09,941
Barricade the door!

1601
01:49:12,685 --> 01:49:15,052
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1602
01:49:15,156 --> 01:49:17,252
Six, five, four, six, three.

1603
01:49:21,935 --> 01:49:24,304
Here! Put some rounds in!

1604
01:49:27,179 --> 01:49:28,613
Master search.

1605
01:49:29,515 --> 01:49:31,508
I got it! We're transmitting!

1606
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,747
Send exactly what I say!

1607
01:49:32,856 --> 01:49:36,989
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1608
01:49:37,097 --> 01:49:41,126
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1609
01:49:41,237 --> 01:49:42,763
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1610
01:49:44,477 --> 01:49:45,502
What was that?

1611
01:49:45,613 --> 01:49:48,448
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1612
01:49:50,621 --> 01:49:52,819
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1613
01:50:17,572 --> 01:50:19,540
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1614
01:50:19,641 --> 01:50:23,081
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1615
01:50:44,321 --> 01:50:45,311
Oh, my God.

1616
01:51:13,908 --> 01:51:15,241
Cool, Mom!

1617
01:51:41,158 --> 01:51:43,151
This is so not good.

1618
01:52:01,664 --> 01:52:03,530
He's behind the pillar!

1619
01:52:09,411 --> 01:52:12,508
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1620
01:52:15,655 --> 01:52:17,989
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1621
01:52:21,867 --> 01:52:23,837
Sucker, burn!

1622
01:52:29,615 --> 01:52:30,947
Oh, shit!

1623
01:52:31,284 --> 01:52:33,311
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1624
01:52:34,524 --> 01:52:36,551
Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.

1625
01:52:37,763 --> 01:52:40,028
Strike and Dark Star roll call.

1626
01:52:42,372 --> 01:52:43,840
Looking out the right side.

1627
01:52:44,743 --> 01:52:46,905
Push to Kill Box One Alpha...

1628
01:52:54,493 --> 01:52:58,058
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1629
01:52:58,167 --> 01:53:00,364
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1630
01:53:00,906 --> 01:53:03,102
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1631
01:53:03,209 --> 01:53:05,509
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1632
01:53:05,915 --> 01:53:08,909
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1633
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:11,957
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1634
01:53:12,059 --> 01:53:14,758
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1635
01:53:15,366 --> 01:53:16,959
F-22 at 12:00.

1636
01:53:17,069 --> 01:53:19,767
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1637
01:53:19,873 --> 01:53:21,740
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1638
01:53:24,248 --> 01:53:26,649
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1639
01:53:26,953 --> 01:53:28,582
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1640
01:53:29,859 --> 01:53:31,020
We have you visual.

1641
01:53:32,697 --> 01:53:34,030
Green smoke is the mark.

1642
01:53:34,134 --> 01:53:37,595
Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.

1643
01:53:42,249 --> 01:53:44,218
It's Starscream!

1644
01:53:44,686 --> 01:53:46,348
Please tell me you copy.

1645
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:48,990
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1646
01:53:52,801 --> 01:53:54,770
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1647
01:53:54,872 --> 01:53:58,038
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1648
01:53:58,145 --> 01:53:59,373
Incoming!

1649
01:54:24,492 --> 01:54:26,291
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1650
01:54:26,396 --> 01:54:27,865
Clear the area!

1651
01:54:33,676 --> 01:54:35,202
Oh, my God.

1652
01:54:36,081 --> 01:54:38,950
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1653
01:54:39,387 --> 01:54:40,718
Your legs.

1654
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:45,924
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1655
01:54:47,468 --> 01:54:49,904
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1656
01:54:51,476 --> 01:54:52,671
Ratchet!

1657
01:54:54,548 --> 01:54:56,016
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1658
01:54:56,117 --> 01:54:58,053
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1659
01:54:58,155 --> 01:55:00,523
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1660
01:55:00,626 --> 01:55:02,789
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1661
01:55:02,897 --> 01:55:05,698
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1662
01:55:06,971 --> 01:55:07,995
Come on!

1663
01:55:08,106 --> 01:55:10,236
Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.

1664
01:55:12,015 --> 01:55:14,143
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1665
01:55:14,251 --> 01:55:16,585
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1666
01:55:34,823 --> 01:55:36,257
Move out! Let's go!

1667
01:55:42,704 --> 01:55:44,401
Let's go! Move!

1668
01:55:51,019 --> 01:55:52,681
I'm not gonna leave you.

1669
01:56:31,827 --> 01:56:33,855
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1670
01:56:40,177 --> 01:56:41,702
Oh, my God!

1671
01:56:54,268 --> 01:56:56,204
Concentrate your fire!

1672
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:08,321
Come on. Come on.

1673
01:57:10,899 --> 01:57:12,596
Megatron!

1674
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:20,978
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1675
01:57:25,259 --> 01:57:26,853
Fall back!

1676
01:57:32,873 --> 01:57:35,070
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1677
01:57:35,178 --> 01:57:37,204
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1678
01:57:37,315 --> 01:57:39,580
We need air cover down here now!

1679
01:57:45,597 --> 01:57:46,997
Sam, help me with this.

1680
01:57:51,173 --> 01:57:55,512
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1681
01:57:55,616 --> 01:57:57,710
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1682
01:57:57,819 --> 01:58:00,119
No! I want two!

1683
01:58:01,693 --> 01:58:03,094
What's going on?

1684
01:58:04,899 --> 01:58:07,529
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1685
01:58:08,405 --> 01:58:10,671
Oh, these things just don't die.

1686
01:58:14,249 --> 01:58:15,741
Oh, we're so dead.

1687
01:58:15,852 --> 01:58:18,187
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1688
01:58:18,491 --> 01:58:19,481
Where's the Cube?

1689
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:20,560
- Right there.
- Okay.

1690
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:21,650
And take that and wrap it around

1691
01:58:21,763 --> 01:58:22,731
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1692
01:58:22,832 --> 01:58:25,497
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1693
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,407
That building.

1694
01:58:32,183 --> 01:58:33,982
- Okay.
- What?

1695
01:58:34,086 --> 01:58:37,056
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1696
01:58:37,157 --> 01:58:39,424
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1697
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:41,726
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1698
01:58:41,834 --> 01:58:43,769
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1699
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:48,278
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1700
01:58:48,379 --> 01:58:50,610
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1701
01:58:50,716 --> 01:58:52,778
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1702
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,411
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1703
01:58:54,524 --> 01:58:55,685
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1704
01:58:55,793 --> 01:58:58,491
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1705
01:58:59,968 --> 01:59:01,026
Army Black Hawk requested.

1706
01:59:01,135 --> 01:59:03,663
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1707
01:59:03,774 --> 01:59:06,301
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1708
01:59:06,412 --> 01:59:09,508
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1709
01:59:11,121 --> 01:59:14,457
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1710
01:59:18,434 --> 01:59:22,567
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1711
01:59:25,814 --> 01:59:28,444
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1712
01:59:28,552 --> 01:59:31,787
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1713
01:59:34,531 --> 01:59:36,625
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1714
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:44,378
Watch out!

1715
01:59:49,992 --> 01:59:53,021
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1716
01:59:53,131 --> 01:59:54,794
Get out of here now!

1717
02:00:22,686 --> 02:00:23,654
Megatron!

1718
02:00:23,955 --> 02:00:24,923
Prime.

1719
02:00:50,905 --> 02:00:52,966
Humans don't deserve to live.

1720
02:00:53,075 --> 02:00:55,739
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1721
02:00:56,182 --> 02:00:58,549
Then you will die with them!

1722
02:01:04,228 --> 02:01:06,631
Join them in extinction!

1723
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:27,532
Keep moving, Sam!

1724
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,907
Don't stop!

1725
02:01:45,939 --> 02:01:46,929
No!

1726
02:02:02,169 --> 02:02:04,264
Sam, get to the building!

1727
02:02:12,187 --> 02:02:14,317
Give me that Cube, boy!

1728
02:02:26,982 --> 02:02:29,077
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1729
02:02:50,457 --> 02:02:53,919
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1730
02:02:59,241 --> 02:03:02,373
I smell you, boy!

1731
02:03:14,602 --> 02:03:15,763
Maggot!

1732
02:03:34,806 --> 02:03:36,400
Oh, no!

1733
02:04:00,989 --> 02:04:02,821
I'll drive! You shoot!

1734
02:04:23,797 --> 02:04:25,095
This isn't going well!

1735
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,600
Shoot! Shoot!

1736
02:05:12,487 --> 02:05:13,716
Nice shot.

1737
02:05:13,822 --> 02:05:17,282
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1738
02:05:27,782 --> 02:05:28,841
Hey!

1739
02:05:32,324 --> 02:05:35,763
Hey! I'm over here!

1740
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:49,815
We've got the boy.

1741
02:05:54,430 --> 02:05:55,865
Watch out!

1742
02:05:56,234 --> 02:05:57,428
Missile!

1743
02:06:07,922 --> 02:06:09,356
Hang on, Sam!

1744
02:06:18,107 --> 02:06:19,440
No! No!

1745
02:06:25,154 --> 02:06:30,187
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1746
02:06:43,755 --> 02:06:45,224
Where do I go?

1747
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:50,523
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1748
02:06:51,837 --> 02:06:53,465
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1749
02:06:57,647 --> 02:07:00,083
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1750
02:07:00,219 --> 02:07:03,019
Oh, so unwise.

1751
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:16,470
I got you, boy.

1752
02:07:18,285 --> 02:07:20,083
Hold on to the Cube!

1753
02:07:39,791 --> 02:07:42,661
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1754
02:07:47,673 --> 02:07:48,698
Sam?

1755
02:07:52,982 --> 02:07:56,216
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1756
02:07:56,957 --> 02:07:58,426
No sacrifice,

1757
02:07:59,795 --> 02:08:02,858
- no victory.
- Lf I cannot defeat Megatron,

1758
02:08:03,201 --> 02:08:05,695
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1759
02:08:06,107 --> 02:08:09,306
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1760
02:08:09,779 --> 02:08:11,248
Get behind me.

1761
02:08:12,953 --> 02:08:15,515
It's you and me, Megatron.

1762
02:08:15,625 --> 02:08:18,562
No, it's just me, Prime.

1763
02:08:21,002 --> 02:08:26,136
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1764
02:08:31,553 --> 02:08:36,393
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1765
02:08:55,565 --> 02:08:57,966
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1766
02:08:58,069 --> 02:09:00,539
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1767
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,665
Hey.

1768
02:09:02,878 --> 02:09:05,041
Bring the rain. All right?

1769
02:09:05,450 --> 02:09:07,442
All right, let's kill these things.

1770
02:09:09,423 --> 02:09:10,983
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1771
02:09:11,094 --> 02:09:13,087
Armor's weak under the chest.

1772
02:09:23,181 --> 02:09:24,741
Target marked. Still waiting.

1773
02:09:24,852 --> 02:09:26,879
Time on target, 20 seconds.

1774
02:09:33,835 --> 02:09:35,930
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1775
02:09:41,182 --> 02:09:42,616
Move out!

1776
02:09:45,857 --> 02:09:47,085
Incoming!

1777
02:09:55,642 --> 02:09:57,737
Weapons armed. Status green.

1778
02:10:16,414 --> 02:10:18,247
Run! Move!

1779
02:10:25,764 --> 02:10:27,289
Second wave's on approach.

1780
02:10:30,807 --> 02:10:32,400
What is that? Break off!

1781
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:34,981
- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...

1782
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:45,893
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1783
02:10:49,976 --> 02:10:52,069
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1784
02:10:52,445 --> 02:10:53,744
Take him out!

1785
02:11:07,974 --> 02:11:09,307
Two's down!

1786
02:11:18,761 --> 02:11:20,696
I'll kill you!

1787
02:11:20,799 --> 02:11:23,566
Mine! All Spark!

1788
02:11:24,539 --> 02:11:27,409
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1789
02:11:28,112 --> 02:11:29,137
Sam!

1790
02:11:30,016 --> 02:11:31,211
No, Sam!

1791
02:11:57,066 --> 02:11:58,226
Hold up.

1792
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:04,313
You left me no choice, brother.

1793
02:12:13,929 --> 02:12:16,799
Sam, I owe you my life.

1794
02:12:17,938 --> 02:12:19,667
We are in your debt.

1795
02:12:39,210 --> 02:12:41,613
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1796
02:12:42,483 --> 02:12:43,781
Jazz.

1797
02:12:46,991 --> 02:12:49,187
We lost a great comrade

1798
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:52,398
but gained new ones.

1799
02:12:52,668 --> 02:12:54,967
Thank you, all of you.

1800
02:12:55,306 --> 02:12:57,673
You honor us with your bravery.

1801
02:12:58,712 --> 02:13:00,683
Permission to speak, sir?

1802
02:13:01,184 --> 02:13:04,052
Permission granted, old friend.

1803
02:13:04,155 --> 02:13:05,624
You speak now?

1804
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,655
I wish to stay with the boy.

1805
02:13:09,533 --> 02:13:11,364
If that is his choice.

1806
02:13:16,312 --> 02:13:17,337
Yes.

1807
02:13:38,018 --> 02:13:42,755
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1808
02:13:43,294 --> 02:13:46,323
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1809
02:13:46,969 --> 02:13:50,270
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,

1810
02:13:50,374 --> 02:13:52,469
deepest place on our planet.

1811
02:13:52,712 --> 02:13:56,242
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1812
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:58,549
would crush and entomb them,

1813
02:14:00,359 --> 02:14:02,090
leaving no evidence.

1814
02:14:08,742 --> 02:14:13,148
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1815
02:14:14,886 --> 02:14:17,482
And fate has yielded its reward,

1816
02:14:19,027 --> 02:14:21,931
a new world to call home.

1817
02:14:28,210 --> 02:14:32,412
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

1818
02:14:32,552 --> 02:14:35,318
but watching over them in secret,

1819
02:14:35,557 --> 02:14:38,120
waiting, protecting.

1820
02:14:39,533 --> 02:14:42,560
I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

1821
02:14:43,172 --> 02:14:46,167
And though we are worlds apart,

1822
02:14:46,278 --> 02:14:51,218
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.

1823
02:14:52,756 --> 02:14:55,249
I am Optimus Prime

1824
02:14:55,661 --> 02:14:59,031
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots

1825
02:14:59,134 --> 02:15:02,129
taking refuge among the stars.

1826
02:15:03,175 --> 02:15:04,904
We are here.

1827
02:15:05,479 --> 02:15:07,506
We are waiting.

1828
02:15:09,476 --> 02:15:21,515

02:15:26,819 --> 02:15:31,851
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1830
02:15:34,866 --> 02:15:40,366
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1831
02:15:40,977 --> 02:15:42,879
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1832
02:15:43,249 --> 02:15:45,684
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1833
02:15:45,786 --> 02:15:47,448
The government would let us know.

1834
02:15:47,623 --> 02:15:49,216
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1835
02:15:49,326 --> 02:15:51,763
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1836
02:15:51,865 --> 02:15:53,494
because there's no secrets.

1837
02:15:53,601 --> 02:15:55,695
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1838
02:16:05,756 --> 02:16:09,059
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.

1839
02:16:10,762 --> 02:16:20,071
